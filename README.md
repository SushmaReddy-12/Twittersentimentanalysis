# Twittersentimentanalysis

This project's aim, is to explore the world of Natural Language Processing (NLP) by building what is known as a Sentiment Analysis Model. A sentiment analysis model is a model that analyses a given piece of text and predicts whether this piece of text expresses positive or negative sentiment.

 we will be using the sentiment140 dataset containing data collected from twitter. An impressive feature of this dataset is that it is perfectly balanced (i.e., the number of examples in each class is equal).
 After a series of cleaning and data processing, and after visualizing our data in a word cloud, we will be building a Naive Bayezian model.
